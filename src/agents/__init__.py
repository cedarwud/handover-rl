RL Agents - Modular Framework for Satellite Handover

This module provides the base agent interface and concrete implementations
of RL algorithms for satellite handover optimization.

Architecture:
    Phase 1 (Refactoring): BaseAgent interface + DQN refactored
    Phase 2 (Baselines): Rule-based comparison methods

Base Classes:
    BaseAgent: Abstract interface for all RL agents

Agents (will be added during refactoring):
    DQNAgent: Deep Q-Network (to be refactored in Task 1.3)

Network Architectures:
    DQNNetwork: Standard DQN architecture
    DuelingDQNNetwork: Dueling DQN architecture (optional)

Utilities:
    ReplayBuffer: Standard experience replay buffer
    PrioritizedReplayBuffer: Prioritized experience replay (optional)

Usage (after refactoring):
    from src.agents import BaseAgent, DQNAgent

    agent = DQNAgent(obs_space, action_space, config)
    action = agent.select_action(state, deterministic=False)
    loss = agent.update(batch)
