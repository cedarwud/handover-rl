type: rule_based_ntn

description: >
  Complete handover strategy based on 3GPP Rel-17 D2 Event (NTN-specific).
  Combines D2 trigger condition + distance selection + handover decision.
  Geometry-aware design considers satellite mobility (distance vs RSRP).

# 3GPP D2 Event Definition
event_definition:
  name: "D2: Serving becomes worse than threshold1 AND neighbour becomes better than threshold2"
  trigger_condition_1: "Ml1 - Hys > Thresh1 (serving too far)"
  trigger_condition_2: "Ml2 + Hys < Thresh2 (neighbor close enough)"
  standard: "3GPP TS 38.331 v18.5.1 Section 5.5.4.15a"
  release: "Rel-17 (NTN standardization)"
  note: "D2 Event itself is only a measurement report trigger"

# Baseline Strategy Contribution
baseline_contribution:
  selection_logic: "Select closest satellite from D2-triggered candidates"
  handover_decision: "Switch if candidate closer than serving satellite"
  ntn_specific: "Considers satellite mobility (distance-based vs RSRP-based)"
  novelty: "First use of D2 event as baseline in RL comparison research"

    ground_station: "Taipei, Taiwan (24.9441°N, 121.3714°E)"
    elevation_constraint: "≥ 10° (Stage 4 visibility criterion)"

  threshold1_derivation:
    value: 1412.8
    unit: "km"
    statistical_basis: "75th percentile"
    meaning: "Serving satellite approaching visibility edge"
    physical_interpretation: "Near maximum link distance for 10° elevation"
    distance_range: "900-1500 km (typical Starlink ground distance)"

  threshold2_derivation:
    value: 1005.8
    unit: "km"
    statistical_basis: "50th percentile (median)"
    meaning: "Neighbor in optimal service position"
    physical_interpretation: "Near zenith (shortest propagation path)"
    signal_quality: "Best RSRP (shortest distance = lowest path loss)"

  hysteresis_margin:
    value: "407 km (threshold1 - threshold2)"
    purpose: "Prevents excessive switching between satellites"
    validation: "Trigger rate = 6.5% (reasonable for LEO NTN)"

# Performance (from orbit-engine real data analysis)
performance:
  trigger_rate_pct: 6.5
  # FROM: orbit-engine Stage 4 analysis (71-day TLE data)
  # MEANING: 6.5% of handover opportunities trigger D2 event
  # VALIDATION: Real Starlink orbital data (101 satellites)
  # COMPARISON: Lower than A4 (54.4%), more selective

  expected_handover_rate_pct: "4-5%"
  # AFTER: D2 trigger + selection + decision logic
  # LOWER: Than A4-based (6-7%) and Strongest RSRP (8-10%)
  # REASON: More conservative (only switches when geometry is poor)

  expected_ping_pong_pct: "4-5%"
  # PROTECTION: Distance hysteresis + large threshold margin
  # BETTER: Than all other baselines (A4: 7-8%, Strongest: 10-15%)
  # REASON: Geometry-based (more stable than RSRP)

  optimal_scenario: "LEO NTN extreme scenarios (serving satellite moving away)"
  # ADVANTAGE: Proactively switches before signal degrades
  # WEAKNESS: May miss opportunities when serving still has good RSRP
