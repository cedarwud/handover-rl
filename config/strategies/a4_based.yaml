# STRATEGY: A4-based (3GPP Standard Event + Selection Logic)
# TYPE: Rule-based (3GPP standard + handover decision)
# USE CASE: Standard baseline for LEO NTN comparison

strategy: a4_based
name: "A4-based Strategy"
type: rule_based_3gpp

description: >
  Complete handover strategy based on 3GPP A4 Event.
  Combines A4 trigger condition + RSRP selection + handover decision.

# 3GPP A4 Event Definition
event_definition:
  name: "A4: Neighbour becomes better than threshold"
  trigger_condition: "Mn + Ofn + Ocn - Hys > Thresh"
  standard: "3GPP TS 38.331 v18.5.1 Section 5.5.4.5"
  note: "A4 Event itself is only a measurement report trigger"

# Baseline Strategy Contribution
baseline_contribution:
  selection_logic: "Select strongest RSRP from A4-triggered candidates"
  handover_decision: "Switch if candidate better than serving satellite"
  ping_pong_protection: "Use hysteresis parameter"

# Parameters (All from official sources)
parameters:
  threshold_dbm: -100.0
  # SOURCE: Yu et al. 2022
  # PAPER: "Performance Evaluation of Handover using A4 Event"
  # FINDING: Optimal threshold for LEO = -100 dBm
  # VALIDATION: Starlink-like LEO constellation

  hysteresis_db: 1.5
  # SOURCE: 3GPP TS 38.331 v18.5.1
  # TYPICAL: 1.5 dB for ping-pong protection
  # RANGE: 0.5 to 5.0 dB

  offset_db: 0.0
  # SOURCE: 3GPP TS 38.331 v18.5.1
  # DEFAULT: 0.0 (no cell-specific offset)
  # RANGE: -24 to +24 dB

# Performance (from orbit-engine real data analysis)
performance:
  trigger_rate_pct: 54.4
  # FROM: orbit-engine Stage 4 analysis (71-day TLE data)
  # MEANING: 54.4% of handover opportunities trigger A4 event
  # VALIDATION: Real Starlink orbital data (101 satellites)

  expected_handover_rate_pct: "6-7%"
  # AFTER: A4 trigger + selection + decision logic
  # LOWER: Than trigger rate (not all A4 events lead to handover)

  expected_ping_pong_pct: "7-8%"
  # PROTECTION: Hysteresis provides some ping-pong protection
  # BETTER: Than Strongest RSRP (10-15%), worse than D2-based (4-5%)

  optimal_scenario: "LEO NTN with RSRP variation < 10 dB"
  # REASON: A4 threshold-based (not relative comparison like A3)
  # LEO: RSRP variation typically < 10 dB (stable signal)
