# Strongest RSRP Strategy Configuration
#
# STRATEGY: Strongest RSRP (Simplest Heuristic Baseline)
# TYPE: Heuristic (parameter-free)
# USE CASE: Baseline lower bound for demonstrating RL improvements

strategy: strongest_rsrp
name: "Strongest RSRP"
type: heuristic

description: >
  Always select satellite with highest RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power).
  No thresholds, no hysteresis, no time-to-trigger.
  Expected to have high handover rate and ping-pong handovers.

# Parameters (None - this is a parameter-free strategy)
parameters: {}

# Metadata
metadata:
  complexity: "O(K)"  # Single pass to find argmax RSRP
  stateless: true     # No memory of previous decisions
  deterministic: true # Same observation â†’ same action

  # Expected performance (from orbit-engine analysis)
  expected_performance:
    handover_rate_pct: "8-10%"     # High (no hysteresis)
    ping_pong_rate_pct: "10-15%"   # High (frequent back-and-forth)
    avg_rsrp_quality: "Good"       # Always selects strongest
    overall_reward: "Poor"         # Handover penalties dominate

  # Use case
  use_case: >
    Baseline lower bound for comparison. Demonstrates why simple
    heuristics are insufficient and shows the value of more
    sophisticated strategies (A4-based, D2-based, RL methods).

  # Comparison baseline
  baseline_type: "lower_bound"
  comparison_role: "Simplest possible strategy (no parameters)"

# Academic compliance
academic_compliance:
  no_mock_data: true        # Uses real RSRP from ITU-R/3GPP physics
  no_simplified_models: true # Complete physics-based RSRP calculation
  traceable_parameters: true # Parameter-free (nothing to trace)
